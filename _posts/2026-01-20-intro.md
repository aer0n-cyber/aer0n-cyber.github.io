# Introduction

Over the past two years, I’ve been building a strong foundation in cybersecurity through formal study, certifications, and hands-on practice. This journey has included completing a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity, earning my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701), and gaining practical experience through TryHackMe. My goal has been to understand how systems are defended, how security teams detect threats, and how incidents are handled in real-world environments.

This blog serves as a professional record of what I’ve learned and how my understanding of cybersecurity has evolved over time.

## Certificate IV in Cybersecurity

I began my cybersecurity education in 2024, at Kangan Institute (Cremorne), which gave me a structured introduction to core security concepts. I learned about networking fundamentals, programming languages, risk management, incident response processes, ethical hacking, cloud computing (AWS), Kali Linux and professional report writing. One of the most valuable lessons from this stage was understanding the importance of documentation, policies, and repeatable processes in security operations.

In addition, there were projects in the course that required working in a team, in which great communication and organisational skills was essential.

Rather than focusing on individual assessments, this certificate helped me develop a disciplined and methodical approach to security problems, which continues to influence how I approach labs and further learning.

## CompTIA Security+

CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) helped me consolidate and expand my theoretical knowledge across a broad range of domains, including authentication, encryption, access control, and security governance. Preparing for this certification strengthened my understanding of how different security controls work together to protect systems and data.

Concepts such as credentialed versus non-credentialed scanning, identity and access management, and risk-based decision-making became much clearer through this process. Security+ also reinforced the importance of thinking defensively and understanding why controls exist, not just how they are implemented.

Two amazing study guides that i utilised throughout my learning included:
- CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Certification Guide by Ian Neil (paperbook)
- Professor Messor: Comptia SY0-701 Security+ Training course (free youtube playlist)

A big thank you to both of these study guides, as it helped me immensley in passing my exam. With Ian Neil's easy to read book, while providing practice exams and flash cards. Professor Messor's free youtube study guide was an addition to my succeess in completing my certification.

## TryHackMe: Pre Security to SOC Level 1

To complement my theoretical studies, I used TryHackMe to gain hands-on experience in a safe, controlled environment. I began with the Pre Security learning path to strengthen my understanding of networking, operating systems, and basic security principles. This helped reinforce the fundamentals that underpin more advanced security work.

I then progressed to SOC Level 1, where I was able to practice skills aligned with real-world security operations. These labs introduced me to alert triage, log analysis, and event correlation from a defensive perspective. Working through SOC-style scenarios helped me better understand how security teams monitor environments and respond to potential threats.

## Key Lessons Learned

Some of the most important lessons from my cybersecurity journey so far include:

- Defensive thinking is just as important as understanding attack techniques
- Clear documentation and structured workflows are critical in incident response
- Hands-on labs significantly improve understanding of theoretical concepts
- Cybersecurity requires continuous learning and reflection
- Foundational knowledge strongly supports advanced security skills
- Great teamwork is essential to complete projects, or day-to-day tasks
- Hand-written and digital notes are essential for retaining information

## Future Goals

Moving forward, I plan to continue developing my SOC-related skills, particularly in log analysis, detection, networking and cloud security fundamentals. I also intend to maintain this blog as a way to document my learning journey and reflect on new concepts as I progress.

Alongside this blog, I am building a GitHub portfolio to safely document lab setups, diagrams, and technical notes that demonstrate my theortical and practical skills.

## Closing

This blog is intended to be a professional reflection of my learning journey in cybersecurity. I hope it’s useful to others who are starting out or considering a similar path. You can find my related technical work on my GitHub profile, and I’m always open to connecting with others who share an interest in cybersecurity.
